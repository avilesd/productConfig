Description: This package provides tools to analyze data created by the use
    of product configurators. Product configurators are about decision making. A
    lot is to be learned from the data generated by their use regarding behavioral
    patterns and the process of decision making. The package offers basic functions
    for examining the data, e.g.'Number of users' up until more complex functions
    based on existing literature, e.g. gain/loss matrices and value functions. The
    functioning of 'productConfig' is based on the principles of prospect theory.
    In order to understand what it does you should be familiar with prospect theory
    and the process it proposes for understanding decision making. Otherwise, we
    recommend the lecture of the papers we based our development on.
