This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Heather?
##Heather?!?!?!?

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load all necessary information without showing it
load("current5_not_at_allclean.RData")
devtools::load_all(".")
library("gplots")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decision_matrix(play_data, 9, attr=1)
heatmap.2(tprueba,col=my_palette, symm=F,symkey=F,symbreaks=T, scale="none", dendrogram="none", Colv= F, Rowv=F,
trace="none", breaks =colbr, margins(6,5))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
